#What Open Source Means To Me

An experiment to see if we can get a bunch of people to send pull requests
about what open source means to them.  See CONTRIBUTING for the expected
format.

Open source to me means standing on the shoulders of giants instead of starting
from scratch every time; reinventing the wheel again and again.  This allows us
to accelerate the rate at which technological break throughs occur.  Open
source allows us to learn from, examine, and understand how the software we use
everyday works, and how we can write better software ourselves.
