#What Open Source Means To Me

An experiment to see if we can get a bunch of people to send pull requests
about what open source means to them.  See CONTRIBUTING for the expected
format.

###[Nick Desaulniers](http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/about/)
Open source means standing on the shoulders of giants, allowing humanity to
accelerate the pace of technological achievement collectively, instead of
wasting time starting from square one repeatedly.  Open source allows us to
examine, learn from, and understand how the software we use everyday works, and
how we can write better software ourselves.  Open source allows us to create a
community around users and contributors.  The opportunity of contribution is
allowed from any and all instead of exclusive rings of those employed by any
one organization.
